# PSAIMS PROJECT PROPOSAL
## INTRODUCTION
All over the world, primary education is considered important not only for children’s cognitive development but also essential for empowering children to choose the appropriate ways of life as members of human society. According to the Tanzanian Primary Education Curriculum of 2007, Teachers have to assess and evaluate the students based on the examination procedure in continuous assessment and completion which includes tests, exercises, examinations, homework, project works, and individual exercises.

Based on this Primary Education Curriculum, at the end of each academic term, teachers are obliged to assess all students by calculating the respective overall performance of each student by including, with appropriate proportionate of the tests, exercises, examinations, homework, project works, and individual exercises. After every assessment, class teachers have to prepare individual student’s terminal reports based on their performance which has to be handled by the student’s parents or guardians.

## BACKGROUND
The whole process of collecting, analyzing, and calculating the overall terminal performance of primary school students is very tiresome work. A teacher has to keep records of every test, every exercise, every examination, every homework, every project work, as well as every individual exercise for every student manually, in pieces of papers, or folders in some quite well-equipped schools.

Through this process, teachers undergo a very tedious journey to evaluate the performance of their students by combining all the information required in their terminal reports. After that, the process of ranking students in what so-called terminal results is followed in order to analyze the trend of academic performance of an individual student. 

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
With reference to the current Primary education system, whereas teachers have to perform a physical recording, calculation, and analysis of the students progress through several test and examination as per education curriculums, sounds tiresome and time consuming hence at some point student analysis may delay due to that.

For that case, the Primary School Academic Information Management System will help the primary schools to keep all records of every student and analyze, evaluate, grade, and report all students accurately and in time, giving correct results. This is also important because it will simplify the work and reduce the burden to the teachers in collecting data and grading the students at the end of the term.

## SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT
With the purpose of reducing the complexity of teachers’ work in collecting, analyzing, grading, evaluating, and reporting all academic matters, The Primary School Academic Information Management System is expected to have the following significance. 
1. The system will help primary schools to safe keep all the students’ academic information in a conducive way without compromising the environment with a paper-based system of keeping records.
2. The system will help teachers to easily fill students’ information in a well-generated data entry system than filling in paper-based score sheets.
3. The system will be a great tool to perform mathematical computation involved in the grading and evaluation of students. This will help to reduce all the faults and human errors that may arise during the process.
4. Moreover, the system will help parents to have a good track of their kid’s progress rather than waiting for a final report annually.
5. The system will also increase the efficiency and effectiveness of teachers’ performance by saving time and money to prepare results.
6. In addition to that, the system will increase parental trust due to the reliability, consistency, correctness, and neatness of the reports generated at the end of every academic term.

## OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT
### MAIN OBJECTIVES
The main objective of the primary school academic information management system is to manage the details of every registered student, their results for every test, in-class exercises, and homework conducted during the whole academic year, a compilation of the results, and providing monthly and annual reports.

### SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES

## PROJECT SCOPE
The first stage of completion of this project is expected to result in the web-based application that will be able to accept teachers’ input on student’s academic information and then analyze grade and generate a report of every individual student.

The second stage of completion is expected to yield the mobile application that will match every capability of its web application counterpart. On its advantage, it’ll help teachers to record student’s information even in places with low or poor network coverage areas.
