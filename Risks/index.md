## PROJECTS RISKS

|Risk 1:| Inherent Schedule Flaws |
|---|---|
|Explanation: | Software development, given the intangible nature and uniqueness of software, is inherently difficult to estimate and schedule.|
|Solution: | Get the team more involved in planning and estimating. Get early feedback and address slips directly with stakeholders.|

|Risk 2: |Requirements Inflation|
|---|---|
|Explanation: |As the project progresses more and more features that were not identified at the beginning of the project emerge that threaten estimates and timelines.|
|Solution: |Constant involvement of customers and developers.|

|Risk 3: |Specification Breakdown|
|---|---|
|Explanation: |When coding and integration begin it becomes apparent that the specification is incomplete or contains conflicting requirements.|
|Solution: |Use a dedicated Product Manager to make critical trade off decisions.|

|Risk 4: |Poor Productivity|
|---|---|
|Explanation: |Given long project timelines or schedules, the sense of urgency to work in earnest is often absent resulting to time lost in early project stages that can never be regained.|
|Solution: |Short iterations, right people on the team, coaching and team development.|

|Risk 5: |Procedural risks|
|---|---|
|Explanation: |Day-to-day operational activities might hamper due to improper process implementation, conflicting priorities, or a lack of clarity in responsibilities.|
|Solution: |Proper division of work plus team work in complicated procedures.|

|Risk 6: |Technical risks|
|---|---|
|Explanation: |Sometimes software development firms reduce the functionality of the software to compensate for overruns pertaining to high budgets and scheduling. There is always a conflict between achieving maximum functionality of the software and peak performance.|
|Solution: |In order to compensate for excessive budget and schedule overruns, organizations sometimes reduce the functionality of the software.|

|Risk 7: |Unavoidable risks|
|---|---|
|Explanation: |These include changes in government policy, the obsolescence of software or other risks that cannot be controlled or estimated. As the field of software development becomes more and more complex, the risks associated with it have intensified. It is vital that development firms focus on strategic planning to mitigate such risks.|
|Solution: |Frequent interaction with the government agencies or authorities concerned.|
